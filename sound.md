# Konfiguracja dźwięku

In this screen the name of the driver that the installer chose for your sound card is given, which will be the default driver if we have a default one.

The default driver should work without problems. However, if after install you do encounter problems, then run draksound or start this tool via MCC (Mageia Control Center), by choosing the Hardware tab and clicking on Sound Configuration at the top right of the screen.

Then, in the draksound or "Sound Configuration" tool screen, click on Advanced and then on Troubleshooting to find very useful advice about how to solve the problem.


####Zaawansowane

Clicking Advanced in this screen, during install, is useful if there is no default driver and there are several drivers available, but you think the installer selected the wrong one.

In that case you can select a different driver after clicking on Let me pick any driver.
